    <h3><u>Career Goals</u></h3>
    <p>
        My current focus in terms of career goals is to complete
        the <a href="https://maxtrain.com">MAX Technical Training</a>
        Java bootcamp in order to give myself a more
        well-rounded base of Java knowledge. At my current
        job at Kroger Technology, I am on a legacy team
        which is being phased out in the near future. I am taking
        part in this bootcamp so that I can transition into one
        of the modern teams and be a valuable asset.
    </p>
    <p>
        Long term, my career goals are to be the best software
        developer that I can be. This includes knowing and being
        proficient in multiple programming languages and having
        many years of experience in each. My plan is to be a
        well-rounded developer who can tackle a problem in many
        different ways. I also desire to mentor young developers
        as my past mentors have mentored me.
